# Koudelka-Noesis-Plugin

Work In Progress Noesis Python plugin for Koudelka (SNK : Sacnoth Digital?Entertainment)

Noesis can be found here : http://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php

- .SDR Model format is relatively well explored (Mesh, Bones & Texture are OK)
- BIM.AR Monster Models Package extracting script is suitable for .SDR models only
- .TX4, TX8 Textures format is almost done

Animations, Effects, Musics & Background Environment Textures remains to do.
I explore formats only by myself, so it take lot of times... hopefully, formats are relatively easy to understand.
